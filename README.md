This project is all about predicting the next laboratory earthquake using CatBoost modelling algorithm. We have uses LANL Earthquake prediction dataset. It was a 9GB datasets. The duration of the project was 2 months. The goal of the project was to build a machine learning model which can help in predicting occurence of next earthquake using seismic signals. Catboost regressor and XGBoost models are used for prediction. 

Project was done in following steps:

Data collection and data cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis using matplotlib and seaborn libraries

Feature Engineering and feature selection

Model building and evaluation

Prediction and Deployment
